This folder contains various parallel programming examples in MATLAB.
It starts with very simple ones, like <a href="parforEx.m">parforEx.m</a>,
which is the most simple way to perform independent tasks in parallel.

The programs <a href="soldiers.m">soldiers.m</a>
and <a href="soldiers2.m">soldiers2.m</a>  implement the initial example
in Chapter 16 (the self-counting platoon of soldiers).
