Parallel Computing with MATLAB and MPI
================================================

This is a tutorial introduction to Parallel Computing
illustrated with examples from MATLAB MPI.

There are also slides in PDF format

The origins
===================================
I collected this information over several years
of teaching these subject and using MATLAB for
various research projects.
