Parallel Computing with MATLAB and MPI
================================================

This is a tutorial introduction to Parallel Computing
illustrated with examples from MATLAB MPI.

There are also slides in PDF format
[ParallelProgramming.pdf](./ParallelProgramming.pdf)
with some discussion of terms and code commentary.

The "Self counting troop" examples
==================================

The source of the example is [David Mackay's book]
(https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf)
and the relevant chapter is [Chapter 16](./240.247.pdf)
included here verbatim for convenience. Also,
there is a [version with my handwritten annotations](./240.247.pdf.pdf).

Parallel Implementation of the Icosian Puzzle solver
=============================================================
This is a parallel implementation of the Icosian Hamilton Circuit
Problem. It is provided in a separate folder [ParallelIcosian](./ParallelIcosian).

The origins
===================================
I collected this information over several years
of teaching these subject and using MATLAB for
various research projects.

Enjoy,
